# Motify

## Introduction
This is a simple Android app designed to work seamlessly with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and a motion sensor. Its main purpose is to notify users whenever motion is detected. The "**PicoW**" folder contains all the code for the Pi Pico W, while all the other folders are meant for the Android app

## **Please Note**
This is still a work in progress as there needs to be more work done behind the scenes to get the networking threads and UI threads to behave more conventionally
